# Prototype Implementations

This directory contains prototype implementations and design explorations for components that will be developed as part of the emeritus-agent project.

## Current Prototypes

### EventCategory.ts

**Related Sub-Issue:** [EventCategory TypeScript Migration](../sub-issues/event-category-typescript-migration.md)  
**Parent Issue:** #60 - Add weather agent to the simulation  

This TypeScript prototype demonstrates the proposed implementation of the EventCategory component, which will be responsible for categorizing weather events in the weather agent system.

#### Key Features:

- **Type-Safe Design**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type definitions
- **Weather Event Modeling**: Represents weather phenomena with severity, duration, and environmental effects
- **Transition System**: Models how weather events can transition from one state to another
- **Probability Calculations**: Computes likelihood of weather events based on current conditions
- **Factory Methods**: Provides convenient creation methods for common weather types
- **Defensive Programming**: Input validation and immutable data structures

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
import { EventCategory } from './EventCategory';

// Create predefined weather categories
const lightRain = EventCategory.createLightRain();
const heavyStorm = EventCategory.createHeavyStorm();

// Check if transitions are possible
const canTransition = lightRain.canTransitionTo(heavyStorm);

// Calculate probability based on conditions
const currentConditions = {
  temperature: 15,
  humidity: 85,
  pressure: 1008,
  windSpeed: 12,
  timeOfDay: 'evening',
  season: 'autumn'
};

const probability = heavyStorm.calculateProbability(currentConditions);
```

#### Integration Points:

This prototype is designed to integrate with:
- Existing BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture
- Weather agent belief system
- Environmental simulation systems
- Time management components

## Purpose

Prototypes serve as:

1. **Design Validation** - Test architectural decisions before full implementation
2. **API Exploration** - Experiment with interfaces and usage patterns
3. **Integration Planning** - Understand how new components fit with existing systems
4. **Documentation** - Provide concrete examples for implementation teams
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Identify potential issues early in the development process

## Development Notes

- Prototypes are not intended for production use
- They may not include full error handling or optimization
- Focus is on demonstrating core concepts and APIs
- Use these as starting points for actual implementation

## Contributing

When adding new prototypes:

1. Create a clear connection to related issues and sub-issues
2. Include comprehensive documentation and examples
3. Focus on key architectural decisions and interfaces
4. Consider integration with existing codebase patterns
5. Update this README with new prototype information
