### EventCategory TypeScript Migration

**File:** [event-category-typescript-migration.md](./event-category-typescript-migration.md)  
**Parent Issue:** #60 - Add weather agent to the simulation  
**Status:** Documented  

This sub-issue describes the migration of the EventCategory component to TypeScript as part of implementing the weather agent feature. The EventCategory component will be responsible for categorizing different types of weather events and their characteristics within the simulation's BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture.

#### Key Components:

- **TypeScript Infrastructure Setup** - Setting up TypeScript tooling and configuration
- **EventCategory Implementation** - Core weather event categorization logic
- **BDI System Integration** - Integration with existing belief/desire/intention systems
- **Testing Strategy** - Comprehensive testing approach for type-safe weather components
- **Migration Guidelines** - Best practices for future JavaScript-to-TypeScript migrations
